While I am doing my professional degree at the University of Chicago, my interest in technology solutions
isn't new. Have been working in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning for over two years now, 
with recent interest in Deep Learning models and currently playing around with various ResNet models. 
Being an Economist, I love delving into the world of conditional probabilities which naturally transforms
into my need to delve into Machine Learning Maths.
